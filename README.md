# **CarbonTreeCode**
This repository contains all the code needed to run an Air Quality Station from the __Carbon Tree__ project!

## **Purpose**

---

An **Air Quality Station** is an _arduino_ based project which can take data from **__4 sensors__** and both **save** and **display** those values. The measured molecules/particles are:

* **CO<sub>2</sub>** (Carbon Dioxide)
* **CO** (Carbon monoxide)
* **NO<sub>2</sub>** (Nitrogen Dioxide)
* **PMs** (suspended Particulate Matter)
    * PM **1.0μm**
    * PM **2.5μm**
    * PM **10.0μm**


The data collected is **displayed** in a 2x16 **LCD display** _and_ **saved** to an **SD card** as table of values which you can open in Excel (.csv format).
