# **CarbonTreeCode**
This repository contains all the code needed to run an Air Quality Station from the __Carbon Tree__ project!

## **Purpose**

---

An **Air Quality Station** is an _arduino_ based project which can take data from **__4 sensors__** and both **save** and **display** those values. The measured molecules/particles are:

* **CO<sub>2</sub>** (Carbon Dioxide)
* **CO** (Carbon monoxide)
* **NO<sub>2</sub>** (Nitrogen Dioxide)
* **PMs** (suspended Particulate Matter)
    * PM **1.0μm**
    * PM **2.5μm**
    * PM **10.0μm**


The data collected is **displayed** in a 2x16 **LCD display** _and_ **saved** to an **SD card** as table of values which you can open in Excel (.csv format).

## **Building a Station**

---

1. To build an Air Quality Station you'll need the **materials** in this 
[**Document**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l7tG8-l5VGNB0ed4CIbOwf0h02rkb5lN/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109219029885592963980&rtpof=true&sd=true).

2. The **assembly** of the Station can be found on this [**Video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLzKA4CCkwY) (subtitles available in English)

3. To install the correct **code** on the Station/Arduino you'll need to install the arduino IDE which can be downloaded from here: [**Arduino_IDE_Link**](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

4. After you've installed the Arduino IDE you'll have to **download** and **upload** the **code** to **Arduino** inside the Station.
The most recent version of the code can be found right above this README.md with a name like: `X.X.X_AirQuality_Station.ino` (X being the version of the code). For further information you can visit this [page](https://learn.adafruit.com/ladyadas-learn-arduino-lesson-number-1/upload-your-first-sketch).
